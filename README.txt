Store

First you will interact with a page containing header , product , product-items and footer component.

Then once click on more details you will go to product details component which based on filtering by id to get details of one product from the database.

After that you will move to cart component containing a validated form once you fill it you can move to orderconfirmation component the last page in the website.

Thanks.
